                        Apple’s iPhone XR was a little bit late to launch after
                        the iPhone XS and XS Max that launched a bit earlier.
                        But thanks to its lower price point, it makes for a more
                        affordable option than the XS models. For some, the
                        powerful internals paired with the large screen and
                        lower price will make for a compelling buy, especially
                        thanks to the surprisingly good battery.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Screen:</strong> The iPhone XR screen isn’t its
                        strongest selling point, as it’s a notable downgrade.
                        It’s resolution falls short of Full HD, and it’s not a
                        battery-friendly OLED. Still, the Liquid Retina LCD
                        display used still has good sharpness and brilliant
                        colors.That said, the 6.1-inch display offers plenty of
                        real estate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Battery life:</strong> Though this is the more
                        affordable iPhone to come out in Apple’s latest batch,
                        its battery life stands out. Thanks to the A12 Bionic
                        and chipset and lower resolution, the battery
                        performance is great, making it the first iPhone that
                        could comfortably get through a whole day of use in our
                        testing without us worrying about.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Camera:</strong> While the other iPhones have
                        dual rear cameras, the iPhone XR has just one sensor.
                        For normal photo shooting, it does a great job though.
                        The lack of a second camera also reduces the quality of
                        Portrait Mode photos. But, the detractors came largely
                        in comparison to other top cameras.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Mini verdict:</strong> The iPhone XR has all the
                        performance of its more expensive siblings on the
                        inside. It’s camera and screen may not be as impressive,
                        but where it truly dazzles is in the battery life. If
                        you want an iPhone with a battery you won’t always worry
                        about, the iPhone XR is it.

                    <p>
                        The iPhone 11 Pro Max is the biggest phone Apple has
                        created, and it's also the most high-spec'd phone from
                        the company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's expensive even by iPhone standards, but it features
                        an all-screen, notch-toting, almost bezel-free design
                        with masses of power under the hood. The big upgrades
                        compared to the iPhone XS Max are the improved cameras
                        and boosted power.&nbsp;
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note: we only picked one of Apple's new top-tier
                        flagships, as the iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone 11 Pro Max
                        are virtually the same phone - but the latter is
                        physically larger (6.5-inch screen vs. 5.8-inch on the
                        11 Pro) and has a higher-capacity battery, so the iPhone
                        11 Pro Max is our pick. If you like smaller phones,

                    <p>
                        <strong>Screen:</strong> The 6.5-inch OLED screen on the
                        iPhone 11 Pro Max really grabbed our attention - it's
                        fantastic for video streaming and gaming.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Battery life: </strong>This is some of the best
                        battery life we've ever experienced on an iPhone, with
                        further optimizations within iOS and a larger cell
                        inside the phone itself. It's still not game-changing,
                        but it's better than other Apple handsets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Camera: </strong>The triple camera setup on the
                        iPhone 11 Pro Max is fantastic. This is the first time
                        Apple has implemented three rear cameras, and it offers
                        a great experience. Plus, it can be fun to use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Mini verdict: </strong>If your hands are as big
                        as your bank balance, the iPhone 11 Pro Max takes
                        Apple's smartphone to a whole new level with an improved
                        camera and more.

                        The Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus is the best phone you can
                        get for Android right now, if you're just going by
                        specs. Naturally, as the first flagship of 2019, its new
                        Snapdragon 855 processor is the big standout here with
                        even better performance than the phones that closed out
                        2018. Add in a few cool new (but not essential)
                        features, Samsung's stunning-as-ever display and design
                        as well as top specs and you have a true flagship – for
                        a true flagship price, of course, starting at
                        &nbsp;$999.

                        <strong>Screen: </strong>The 6.4-inch Super AMOLED
                        display is gorgeous, but that's not surprising. it's the
                        same size as the Galaxy Note 9's screen, and far larger
                        than the Galaxy S9 Plus' 6.2-inch display. The 'Infinity
                        O' display ditches the notch for a punch-hole in the top
                        right corner. Yes, it's twice as wide as the hole in the
                        S10 and S10e, but how else will you fit in the extra
                        selfie camera? This choice (and thin bezels) enable a
                        stunning 93.1% screen-to-body ratio, which keeps the
                        phone as slim as possible.

                        <strong>Battery Life: </strong>The S10 Plus' 4,100mAh
                        battery is Samsung's largest yet, just nudging past the
                        Note 9's 4,000mAh and far beyond the 3,500mAh one in the
                        Galaxy S9 Plus. While that didn't lead the new phone's
                        battery life to outpace its predecessors, it still kept
                        it going through the full day with 10%-30% to spare in
                        our casual testing. This is, of course, with standard
                        settings: bump up the resolution from Full HD+ to QHD+,
                        brighten the display or keep it on longer, and the
                        battery will drain faster.

                        <strong>Camera: </strong>The S10 Plus has three cameras
                        on the back: a 12MP regular lens, a 12MP optically
                        zoomed telephoto lens, and a new 16MP ultra-wide lens.
                        We found the photo quality to be a bit variable –
                        perhaps due to the dual-aperture main lens – with good
                        but not consistent low-light performance. It's not quite
                        up to par with the Google Pixel 3's Night Vision mode,
                        but it still outpaces most other phone cameras on the
                        market. The two front-facing cameras allow depth for
                        Portrait mode-style photos, which is worth the wider
                        punch-hole gap in the display.

                        <strong>Mini verdict: </strong>After some time with the
                        standard Galaxy S10 and Galaxy S10e, we can say for sure
                        that the S10 Plus beats them out. It has the best specs,
                        cameras and battery life of the whole set, and it's not
                        too much more expensive than the other models. If you
                        want a phone that will blow every other device out of
                        the water in early 2019 – as well as its in-screen
                        fingerprint sensor and reverse charging – this is your
                        only real option.&nbsp;
